            <p>I led the design of Prime Music for the Digital Music Store across Kindle Fire, Fire Phone, iOS, Android, Desktop and Web since the outset of the project in July 2013.</p>
            <p>Up until July 2015, I led efforts to evolve the service and address customer pain‐points related to the browse and discovery experience.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Create Deeper Relationships with Customers</h3>
            <p>Since 2013, digital music download sales have declined and now a sizable proportion of the music industry’s revenue is made up by on‐demand streaming services. For Amazon, this signaled a rapid change in music consumption habits.</p>
            <p>Our challenge was to evolve with customers and enter the highly competitive on‐demand streaming music segment in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Prime Music would offer a limited selection of a million songs and catalogue titles (at least six months old), exclusive for Prime members to stream and download. With this new benefit we hoped to create deeper relationships with Amazon customers.</p>
